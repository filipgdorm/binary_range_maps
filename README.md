# Generating Binary Range Maos

Code for binarizing the output of global-scale species range estimation models. This code enables the recreation of the results from our workshop paper [link]

## 🌍 Overview 
Accurate predictions of species’ ranges are crucial for assisting conservation efforts. Traditionally, range maps are manually created by experts. However, species distribution models (SDMs) and, more
recently, deep learning-based variants offer a potential automated alternative. Deep learning-based SDMs generate a continuous probability representing the presence of a species at a given location, which must be binarized by setting per-species thresholds to obtain binary range maps. However, selecting appropriate per-species thresholds to binarize
these predictions is non-trivial, since different species can require different thresholds. In this work, we evaluate different approaches for automatically identifying the best thresholds for binarizing range maps using presence-only data. This includes approaches that require the generation
of additional pseudo-absence data, along with ones that only require presence data. We also propose an extension of an existing presence-only technique that is more robust to outliers. We perform a detailed evaluation of different thresholding techniques on the tasks of binary range estimation and large-scale fine-grained visual classification, and we demonstrate
improved performance over existing approaches using our technique.



## 🔍 Getting Started 

#### Installing Required Packages

1. We recommend using an isolated Python environment to avoid dependency issues. Install the Anaconda Python 3.9 distribution for your operating system from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download). 

2. Create a new environment and activate it:
```bash
 conda create -y --name binary_range_maps python==3.9
 conda activate binary_range_maps
```

3. After activating the environment, install the required packages:
```bash
 pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Downloading the SINR Code
This range map binarization is an extension of https://github.com/elijahcole/sinr which needs to be cloned as a folder into this repo (such that there is a folder `sinr/*`). [note to self: depending on if shipped with clone, include setup instructions or not]


#### SINR Data Download and Preparation
Instructions for downloading the SINR data, which is needed for further experiments, are in `sinr/data/README.md`.

#### Data setup for pseudo-absence generation
In order to create pseudo-absences, the training data needs to be formatted.

#### Downloading models
To use the models in the paper, simply run the following command:
```
curl xxx
```
